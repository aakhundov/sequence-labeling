GloVe Word Embeddings
=====================

The files with [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) word embeddings should be copied to this folder. Each embedding file should be uncompressed and have the original name (e.g. "glove.6B.100d.txt"). The version of the embeddings specified as a command-line argument of **train.py** corresponds to the suffix coming after "glove" in the name of the embeddings file (e.g. "6B.100d" for 100-dimensional 6B Wikipedia embeddings).
