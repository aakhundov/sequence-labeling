Senna Word Embeddings
=====================

The entire [Senna](https://ronan.collobert.com/senna/) project should be copied to this folder. The files "hash/words.lst" and "embeddings/embeddings.txt" are then used for retrieving word embeddings. The version of the embeddings specified as a command-line argument of **train.py**  is not relevant, as there is only one version (English, 50-dimensional).
