Polyglot Word Embeddings
========================

The files with [Polyglot](https://sites.google.com/site/rmyeid/projects/polyglot#TOC-Download-the-Embeddings) word embeddings should be copied to this folder. Each embedding file should have the original name (e.g. "polyglot-de.pkl"). The version of the embeddings specified as a command-line argument of **train.py** corresponds to the language suffix (e.g. "de" for German embeddings).
